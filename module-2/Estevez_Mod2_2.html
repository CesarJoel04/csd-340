        <h2>A Few Things About Myself</h2>
        
        <p class="intro">Growing up in the beautiful Dominican Republic, I was immersed in a rich and vibrant culture. From the lively music to the mouthwatering cuisine, my homeland holds a special place in my heart. 
          However, in November 2010, I embarked on an exciting journey that would forever change my life: I moved to the United States. This move was both exhilarating and nerve-wracking, as I left behind the familiarity 
          of my hometown to embrace new opportunities and experiences in a foreign land. Since then, I have relished the chance to explore the diverse landscapes and cultures that the United States has to offer.</p>
        
        <p>Sports have always been a significant part of my life, serving as a source of joy and personal growth. Among my top hobbies are basketball, baseball, tennis, and swimming. Playing basketball fuels my competitive spirit,
          while baseball allows me to connect with the sport's rich history and tradition. Tennis offers a mix of skill, strategy, and elegance that I find captivating. Lastly, swimming provides me with a refreshing escape from 
          the daily grind and also doubles as a great way to stay fit. Engaging in these sports not only keeps me physically active but also brings me immense happiness.</p>
        
        <p>In April 2022, I experienced yet another milestone in my life by getting married. Joining my partner in holy<span class="sentence">CSS class</span> matrimony was a moment filled with joy and anticipation for the future. We are both excited to embark on 
          this new chapter together, supporting and cherishing each other every step of the way. Building a loving and caring family is a dream we share, and we look forward to the adventures and challenges that await us.
          Our union is grounded in love, respect, and a shared commitment to nurturing a harmonious relationship.</p>
        
        <p>My journey from the Dominican Republic to the United States has been a transformative experience that has shaped my values and aspirations. Along the way, I have cultivated a deep passion for various sports, 
          including basketball, baseball, tennis, and swimming, which continue to bring me immense joy and fulfillment. Additionally, I am thrilled to have recently entered into the institution of marriage, 
          taking the first steps toward building a loving and supportive family. Through it all, I am grateful for the opportunities and experiences that life has presented me, and I eagerly embrace what the future holds.</p>
