        <h2>A Few Things About Myself</h2>
        
        <p class="intro">Growing up in the beautiful <span id = "Dominican">_________</span> Republic, I was immersed in a rich and vibrant culture. From the lively music to the mouthwatering cuisine, my homeland holds a special place in my heart.
          However, in November 2010, I embarked on an exciting journey that would forever change my life: I moved to the United States. This move was both exhilarating and nerve-wracking, as I left behind the familiarity 
          of my hometown to embrace new opportunities and experiences in a foreign land. Since then, I have relished the chance to explore the diverse landscapes and cultures that the United States has to offer.</p>
        
        <p>Sports have always been a significant part of my life, serving as a source of joy and personal growth. Among my top hobbies are basketball, baseball, tennis, and swimming. Playing basketball fuels my competitive spirit,
          while <span id = "baseball">________</span> allows me to connect with the sport's rich history and tradition. Tennis offers a mix of skill, strategy, and elegance that I find captivating. Lastly, swimming provides me with a refreshing escape from
          the daily grind and also doubles as a great way to stay fit. Engaging in these sports not only keeps me physically active but also brings me immense happiness.</p>
        
          <p>In April 2022, I experienced yet another milestone in my life by <span id = "getting married">_______________</span>.<span class="sentence"> Joining my partner in holy matrimony was a moment filled with joy and anticipation for the future.</span> We are both excited to embark on
          this new chapter together, supporting and cherishing each other every step of the way. Building a loving and caring family is a dream we share, and we look forward to the adventures and challenges that await us.
          Our union is grounded in love, respect, and a shared commitment to nurturing a harmonious relationship.</p>
        
        <p>My journey from the Dominican Republic to the <span id = "United States">______________</span> has been a transformative experience that has shaped my values and aspirations. Along the way, I have cultivated a deep passion for various sports,
          including basketball, baseball, tennis, and swimming, which continue to bring me immense joy and fulfillment. Additionally, I am thrilled to have recently entered into the institution of marriage, 
          taking the first steps toward building a loving and supportive family. Through it all, I am grateful for the opportunities and experiences that life has presented me, and I eagerly embrace what the future holds.</p>
